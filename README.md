Hello!

My name is Logan, a candidate of the Masters of Computational Analysis and Public Policy (MSCAPP) program at the University of Chicago. My research interests are implementing computational, simulation, and causal inference methods in political science and macroeconomic modelling. 

Prior to MSCAPP, I was an Economist working for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation where I contributed to the policy implemention of the pilot ACO Shared Savings Program PC Flex
